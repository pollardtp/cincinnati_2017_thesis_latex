I'd like to thank my friends and family for their support throughout my graduate school tenure. I'm especially grateful to my advisor Tom Beck for his 
outstanding mentoring and patience. I'm also grateful to NSF, P$\&$G, and the Ohio Supercomputer Center for research support and computer time. 
Additional funding was given by the Hans H. Jaff$\acute{\mathrm{e}}$ award in physical chemistry and the Twitchell Academic Fellowship. I'm appreciative
to the families for their continued support of students in the department.

Many thanks to Will Benton for developing the guts of the \LaTeX~template used for this thesis and to Share\LaTeX~for hosting it (and also taking the 
hassle out of making sure everything is saved \emph{exactly} infinity times).
